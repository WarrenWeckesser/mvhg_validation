# mvhg_validation
Scripts for validating the multivariate hypergeometric distribution in NumPy.

The scripts are used to evaluate the multivariate hypergeometric distribution
that is currently in my `new-mvhg` branch of NumPy.

They require `mpmath` and `mpsci` (https://github.com/WarrenWeckesser/mpsci).
